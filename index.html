	<h2> About EYIP </h2>
	<p> Empowering Youth in Politics is an after school program for High School Students. We aim to engage and excite students about in politics, provide them with a safe and comfortable learning experience, and teach them skills they can apply beyond the classroom</p>
</div>
	<h2>Goal</h2>
	<p> Our mission is to inspire students to become the next generation of compassionate and informed politicians, and to enact positive change through their own political voices. EYIP's main goal is to get students excited about politics! The political realm affects your daily life in ways you may not be aware of. We want students to gain knowledge about how politicians get into office, and the skills to run a mini-campaign within the class. </p>
	<h2>How it Works</h2>
	<p> During the first class, all students participating in EYIP randomly select a state. For the remainder of the semester, each student then builds a campaign as a Senator of that state. They choose one of five issues that are relevant on a federal level to use as their platform. Throughout the semester, workshops are developed around these concepts so that the lessons are tied into the hands-on activity. In this way, students are active learners and participants.</p>
