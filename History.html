	<h2> How We Started </h2>
	<p> EYIP began in the fall of 2014. One day, Angel Wang was looking at the democgraphics of Capitol Hill and realized it is very homogenous. There are only 20 female senators, 35 people of Hispanic or Latino descent, and only one African American senator. Our country is incredibly diverse and looking at those numbers, we realized that this diversity wasn't reflected in our government. So, Angel came up with the idea to create an after school program to encourage youth of all different backgrounds to be active in politics! Angel reached out to other friends, Breton Carter and Jess Swanson to hear more feedback. Everyone who heard about the program was excited. With this small group, they then created a curriculum and planned classes that could be taught over the course of a semseter. And they gave it a name: Empowering Youth in Politics (EYIP for short). The next step was to reach out to local community centers to be implement the curriculum. After reaching out to several organizations, EYIP partenered with Hudson Guild Beacon, a community organization primarily focused in Chelsea. The Spring of 2015, EYIP began teaching their first two classes of students and so far has been a success. </p>
