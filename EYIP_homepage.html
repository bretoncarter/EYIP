	<h2> About EYIP </h2>
	<p> Empowering Youth in Politics is an after school program for High School Students. We aim to engage and excite students in politics, provide them with a safe and comfortable learning experience, and teach them skills they can apply beyond the classroom</p>
	<h2>Goals</h2>
	<p> Our mission is to inspire students to become the next generation of compassionate and informed politicians, and to enact positive change through their own political voices. EYIP's main goal is to get students excited about politics! THe political realm affects your daily life in ways you may not be aware of. We want students to gain knowledge about how politicians get into office, and the skills to run a mini-campaign in the class. </p>
