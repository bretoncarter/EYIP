	<h2> Our Curriculum </h2>
	<p> Our curriculum is designed to be a semester long after school course for high school students. Each student assumes the role of a Senator and completes coursework for that role. Each class is centered around a specific theme that allows students to simultaneously learn about politics while gaining core hands-on skills. The course is divided into nine lectures culminating in an open house presentation where students can demonstrate what they have learned and show the materials they have created over the course of the semester. Our curriculum provides for growth and teamwork while honestly discussing the various and complicated aspects of running a campaign. </p>
